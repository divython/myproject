In my projects, I've developed two applications. 
The first project employs ImageNet EfficientNet 
pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
for image classification. Leveraging EfficientNet's 
pretraining, this system accurately categorizes images
into various classes, enhancing automated image understanding. 
The second project involves building a YouTube comment sentiment analyzer. 
It extracts comments from specified URLs and performs sentiment analysis, categorizing 
the sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis provides valuable insights
into audience reactions to YouTube content."""
